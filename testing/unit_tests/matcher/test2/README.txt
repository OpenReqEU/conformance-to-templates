Testing simple2 funcionality, with two elements on match tree, elements can be one of the three possibilities
The tree to match is a two node tree (all possibilities)
The requirements are different but simple

OUTPUTS:
tree1 -> req1 -> true
tree2 -> req1 -> false
tree3 -> req1 -> false
tree4 -> req1 -> false
tree5 -> req1 -> false
tree8 -> req1 -> false

tree1 -> req2 -> true
tree2 -> req2 -> true
tree3 -> req2 -> false
tree4 -> req2 -> true
tree5 -> req2 -> false
tree8 -> req2 -> true
